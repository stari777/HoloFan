 	# APA102 driver for STM32 for HAL library

* developed by HansAchterbahn, since July 2019
* forked from [Remko Welling](https://github.com/pe1mew/APA102-on-STM32), May 2016


## Genaral

This library implements the APA102 digital LED using the famous STM32 HAL library.

_Have fun with this library, improve and share it!_

## Usage

To get this library working do the following steps.

#### STM32CubeMx

* use [STM32CubeMx](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) to create a new STM32 project based on your board or microcontroller
* add an SPI interface with following settings:
	* __Frame Format:__ Motorola
	* __Data Size:__ 8 Bits
	* __First Bit:__ MSB First
	* __Prescaler:__ << Baudrate needs to be between 800 and 1200 kHz/s >>
	* __Clock Polarity (CPOL):__ Low
	* __Clock Phase (CPHA):__ 1 Edge
	* __CRC Calculation:__ Disabled
	* __NSSP Mode:__ Disabled
	* __NSS Signal Type:__ Software
* create project and open it in your IDE (I use STM32CubeIDE)


#### STM32CubeIDE

* open your CubeMx generated Project in [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html) (or your favorite IDE)
* add the file
	* __DigiLed.h__ to __Inc__ folder
	* __DigiLed.c__ to __Scr__ folder
* initial the DigiLed library by using the function `DigiLed_init(*hspi)`
* it expects at __*hspi__ a pointer to the __SPI handler__ which is responsible for the SPI handling of the APA102 LEDs
* to the end add the LED frame size by changing the `LED_FRAME_SIZE` value in the DigiLed.h file to the amount of LEDs you are working with
* ___now you are ready to go !___
	* try changing the color of all LEDs by using 'void DigiLed_setAllColor(red, green, blue)' or
	* try to change the color of a single LED by using 'DigiLed_setColor(led, red, green, blue)'
	* To make your changes take effect, you must apply the DigiLed_update() function at the end of your changes
* the files __LightEffect.h/.c__ contain a library for simple light effects on a 4×4 APA102 matrix (`LED_FRAME_SIZE = 16`)
	* you can easily include them in the same way in your project sources and modify the effects to have quick success with your project
